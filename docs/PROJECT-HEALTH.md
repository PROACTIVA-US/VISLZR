## Overall Status
ðŸŸ¢ Green - Project starting, foundation being established

## Phase Progress
- Phase 0: âšª Not Started (Week 1) - Foundation & Cleanup
- Phase 1: âšª Not Started (Weeks 2-3) - Sibling Nodes
- Phase 2: âšª Not Started (Weeks 4-5) - Advanced Visualizations
- Phase 3: âšª Not Started (Weeks 6-8) - AI Integration
- Phase 4: âšª Not Started (Weeks 9-10) - Code Integration

## Key Metrics
- PRD Alignment: -% (baseline to be established)
- Test Coverage: -% (baseline to be established)
- Performance: - fps (target: 30fps on 500+ nodes)
- Security Score: -/10 (baseline to be established)

## This Week's Goals
1. Create unified project structure âœ…
2. Migrate code from Vislzr-main
3. Establish baseline tests
4. Complete gap analysis

## Blockers
None currently

## Risks
1. **Learning Curve**: New team members need to understand PRD
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive documentation, clear examples

2. **Scope Creep**: Feature requests outside PRD
   - Mitigation: Always reference PRD before implementing

## Next Milestones
- Week 1: Phase 0 complete
- Week 3: Sibling nodes working
- Week 5: All visualizations complete
