# VISLZR - Master Product Requirements Document
**Version 1.0 - Unified Specification**

## Executive Summary

**Vislzr is an AI-native interactive canvas for software project visualization, management, and execution.** It transforms complex project structures into a dynamic, intelligent mind map that serves as the single source of truth for development teams.

**Core Innovation:** The canvas IS the UI. Not a picture of the project, but the project itself‚Äîa living workspace where 90% of tasks are performed through context-aware, on-canvas interactions.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Modern software development suffers from fragmentation:

### Pain Points
- **Information Silos**: Critical data scattered across Git, CI/CD, task managers, security scanners
- **Lack of Context**: Dependencies, task statuses, and risks are difficult to grasp at a glance
- **Reactive Management**: Teams react to problems rather than proactively identifying them
- **Cognitive Overload**: Constant context switching between disconnected tools
- **Static Tooling**: No single pane of glass providing both overview and deep, actionable insights

### User Impact
- Developers waste time hunting for information instead of building
- Project managers struggle to identify real bottlenecks and risks
- Stakeholders lack visibility into project health and security posture
- Teams miss dependencies and deadlines due to poor information flow

---

## 2. Vision & Core Principles

### Vision Statement
**Vislzr will be the central nervous system for software development**‚Äîa unified, intelligent workspace where project structure, status, and strategic planning converge into a single, interactive visualization.

### Core Design Principles

#### 2.1 The Canvas is the UI
We reject disconnected panels and fragmented workflows. The mind map is not a *representation* of the project; it *is* the project. All actions, insights, and interactions happen in context on the canvas.

#### 2.2 Context is King
All actions and information adapt to the currently selected component. The UI morphs to user focus, reducing cognitive load and improving feature discoverability.

#### 2.3 Developer-First Strategy
Our primary focus is the **Developer-First Mapping** use case: visualizing, understanding, and acting upon existing or in-progress codebases. The project hierarchy directly maps to technical components (Frontend, Backend, Database, CI/CD).

#### 2.4 AI as Co-Pilot
Generative AI is not a one-time setup tool‚Äîit's an integrated partner providing on-demand analysis, suggestions, code reviews, and strategic recommendations throughout the development lifecycle.

#### 2.5 Progressive Disclosure
Show only what's needed, when it's needed. Start simple (root node), reveal complexity on demand. Keep the canvas uncluttered while maintaining access to deep functionality.

## 4. Core Feature Specification

### 4.1 The Interactive Canvas

#### Visual Language System
A multi-layered system of visual cues for instant information comprehension.

##### Node Status Ring (Border Color)
The node border acts as a "traffic light":

| Color | Meaning | Use Case |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Red (Pulsing)** | Urgent attention | `OVERDUE` task, `ERROR` service, critical vulnerability |
| **Yellow** | Caution/Warning | `AT_RISK` task, service warning, non-critical issue |
| **Blue** | Active/In Progress | `IN_PROGRESS` task, active development |
| **Green** | Healthy/Complete | `COMPLETED` task, `RUNNING` service (healthy) |
| **Indigo/Purple** | Idle/Waiting | `IDLE` or `STOPPED` service, `WAITING` task |
| **Gray** | Structural/Neutral | `FOLDER`, `FILE`, reference nodes |
| **Teal** | Root/Anchor | `ROOT` node (project anchor) |

##### Status Icons
Inside each node, explicit icons replace ambiguous dots:
- ‚úì Checkmark: `COMPLETED`
- ‚ö† Warning triangle: `AT_RISK`
- ‚óè Pulsing dot: `RUNNING`
- ‚è∏ Pause symbol: `IDLE`/`STOPPED`
- ‚è± Clock: `SCHEDULED`/`PENDING`
- ‚ùå X mark: `ERROR`/`BLOCKED`

##### Intelligent Connection Lines
Lines communicate relationship health:

| Line Style | Color | Meaning |
|------------|-------|---------|
| **Solid thick** | Bright red | Blocked dependency (prerequisite incomplete) |
| **Solid** | Blue | Met dependency (path clear) |
| **Dashed** | Gray | Reference link (non-blocking) |
| **Solid** | Gray | Parent-child structural link |

#### Node Types
```typescript
type NodeType = 
  | 'ROOT'           // Project root
  | 'FOLDER'         // Directory/container
  | 'FILE'           // Source file
  | 'TASK'           // Work item with status
  | 'SERVICE'        // Backend service, API, database
  | 'COMPONENT'      // UI component, module
  | 'DEPENDENCY'     // External dependency (npm, docker)
  | 'MILESTONE'      // Project milestone
  | 'IDEA'           // Future feature, brainstorm
  | 'NOTE'           // Documentation, comment
  | 'SECURITY'       // Security finding (CVE, vulnerability)
  | 'AGENT'          // AI agent or monitor
  | 'API_ENDPOINT'   // API route
  | 'DATABASE'       // Database instance
```

#### Node Status States
```typescript
type NodeStatus =
  | 'IDLE'           // Not started
  | 'PLANNED'        // Scheduled but not active
  | 'IN_PROGRESS'    // Active work
  | 'AT_RISK'        // At risk of becoming overdue
  | 'OVERDUE'        // Past deadline
  | 'BLOCKED'        // Cannot proceed (dependency/issue)
  | 'COMPLETED'      // Done
  | 'RUNNING'        // Service is active (healthy)
  | 'ERROR'          // Service or task in error state
  | 'STOPPED'        // Service stopped/paused
```

### 4.2 Contextual Interaction: Sibling Nodes

**Sibling Nodes** are the primary interaction mechanism, replacing traditional sidebar panels.

#### Concept
Transient, button-like nodes that appear adjacent to a selected primary node, offering context-aware commands.

#### Behavior
- **Appearance**: Slim, compact, visually distinct from project nodes
- **Positioning**: Stack or arc adjacent to selected node

## 12. Appendix

### A. Terminology

**Sibling Node**: Transient, contextual action button that appears adjacent to a selected primary node

**Dependency Chain**: Sequence of nodes where one depends on another (upstream = what you need, downstream = what needs you)

**Blocked Dependency**: A dependency relationship where the prerequisite is not complete, preventing work

**Consensus Agent**: System that queries multiple AI models and aggregates their responses

**Project Pack**: Industry-specific template with custom node types, actions, and integrations

**Health Ring**: Visual border around a node indicating its current status/health

**Focus Mode**: Visualization state that highlights specific relationships (e.g., dependencies) while dimming others

**Canvas-Centric**: Design philosophy where the primary interaction surface is the visualization, not panels

### C. Open Questions

1. **Collaboration UX**: How to handle merge conflicts in real-time multi-user scenarios?
2. **Mobile Experience**: Is a full mobile app needed, or is mobile-responsive web sufficient?
3. **Offline Support**: Should Vislzr work offline with sync when reconnected?
4. **Graph Size Limits**: What's the practical limit for node count? 1000? 10,000?
5. **AI Model Selection**: Should users choose which AI model to use, or should Vislzr decide?
6. **Data Privacy**: How to handle sensitive code/data in AI queries? Local LLM option?
7. **Versioning**: Should there be a git-like version control for the entire graph?
